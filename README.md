# Playing Rock, Paper, Scissors with AI

Rock Paper Scissors is a hand game for two or more players. Participants say “rock, paper, scissors” and then simultaneously form their hands into the shape of a rock (a fist), a piece of paper (palm facing downward), or a pair of scissors (two fingers extended). 
 
The rules are straightforward :

- Rock smashes scissors
- Paper covers rock
- Scissors cut paper
